In this directiory you will find many scripts all relating to some type of numerical simulation involving Brownian motion. 

Examples of the simulations can be found in the GIFsAndPicutures folder insider this directory.

Brownian motion can genrate some very artistic simulations! These simulations also illustrate my favorite mathematical concept: the existance of everywhere continuous but nowhere differentiable functions. An even more facinating fact is that continuous function possessing at least one derivitive are meager in the space of continuous functions.
